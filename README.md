# stock

`stock` is a language:

- Where the code you write says what it means.
- Where writing code is fast and simple.
- That is designed to avoid common bugs.

The main ideas of `stock`:

1. **Performance**: you use cool abstractions, you get fast code
2. ***Almost* no magic**: the stock standard library is *mostly* written in stock
3. **Code that speaks**: the language is built for humans first, reading the language must be easy
